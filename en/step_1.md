## Introduction

You are going to make a dragonfly that grows bigger as it eats annoying mosquitos and other insects.

You will:
+ Use `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks to change what a sprite does when a condition is true; create conditions using `operators`{:class="block3operators"} and `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"} blocks including `when touching`{:class="block3sensing"}.
+ Use `random`{:class="block3operators"} numbers to control the movement of a sprite
+ Use the `Sounds`{:class="block3sound"}  editor to edit a sound

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
We use <span style="color: #0faeb0">**conditions**</span> all the time to make decisions. We could say “if it’s raining, then take an umbrella”. If blocks and conditions let us write code that does something different depending on whether a condition is true or false.</p>

--- task ---

Right-click on the **Insect** sprite in the Sprite list under the Stage and **duplicate** it.

![The Sprite list with the insect sprite selected and 'duplicate' highlighted in the menu.](images/duplicate-insect.png)

--- /task ---

Make this insect look different to the fly.

--- task ---

Click on the **Costumes** tab and create a different flying insect.

+ Use the **Fill** tool to change the colour of this insect.
+ **Paint** your own insect costume.
+ **Add** another bug costume from Scratch.

--- /task ---

The insect gets eaten even if it touches the dragonfly's wing or tail.

To make your app more realistic, fix this so that the insect gets eaten by the dragonfly's mouth. You can use the `touching color`{:class="block3sensing"} block so the insect only gets eaten if it is touches a particular colour on the **Dragonfly**.

--- task ---

Select the **Dragonfly** sprite and click on the **Costumes** tab.

Use the fill tool to fill in the **Dragonfly**'s mouth. We used purple:

--- /task ---

You need to check that the new sprite is touching the **Dragonfly** sprite `and`{:class="block3operators"} touching the colour of the dragonfly's mouth.

--- task ---

Select your new sprite and click on the **Code** tab.

Drag an `and`{:class="block3operators"} block into the `if`{:class="block3control"} block.

The `<touching [Dragonfly v] ?>`{:class="block3sensing"} block will pop out, drag it into a space in the `and`{:class="block3operators"} block:

![](images/insect2-icon.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
show
forever
move [3] steps 
if on edge, bounce
+if <<touching [Dragonfly v] ?> and <>> then
broadcast [food v]
hide
go to (random position v)
show
end
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag a `touching color`{:class="block3sensing"} block into the other space of the `and`{:class="block3operators"} block:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
show
forever
move [3] steps
if on edge, bounce
+if <<touching [Dragonfly v] ?> and <touching color (#9966ff) ?>> then
broadcast [food v]
hide
go to (random position v)
show
end
end
```

If it doesn't have the colour of the dragonfly's mouth selected, click on the colour circle and then click on the **Eyedropper** tool at the bottom to select a colour.

![The colour circle menu with eyedropper tool.](images/colour-eyedropper.png)

Click on the dragonfly's mouth on the Stage to set the colour:

**Tip:** If the small mouth is hard to select, make the **Dragonfly** sprite bigger.

**Test:** Check the dragonfly can only eat the second insect with its mouth.

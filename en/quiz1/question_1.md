## Reflection

Well done, you created a nature app with a dragonfly controlled by the user and insects that follow an algorithm! 

You have used `Events`{:class="block3events"}, `Control`{:class="block3control"}, `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"}, `Operators`{:class="block3operators"}, `Motion`{:class="block3motion"}, `Looks`{:class="block3looks"}, and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks!

Now it's time to reflect â€” reflecting is an important part of learning, because it helps make new connections in your brain.

Answer the three questions below to reflect on what you've learned.

legend: Question 1 of 3

A project uses the **Crab** sprite and the **Jellyfish** sprite. The **Crab** sprite has this code:

![desc](images/crab-icon.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
if <not <touching color (#0000FF)?>> then
hide
end
```

What would need to happen for the **Crab** sprite to hide?

--- choices ---

- () The **Crab** sprite would need to touch the **Jellyfish**

 --- feedback ---

 No, the `if`{:class="block3control"} block has a `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"} condition, but it does not use the `touching Jellyfish`{:class="block3sensing"} block.

- (x) The **Crab** sprite would need to not be touching the colour blue

 --- feedback ---

Yes, the `not`{:class="block3operators"} operator means that the condition is true `if`{:class="block3control"} the **Crab** sprite is not `touching`{:class="block3sensing"} the colour blue.

 --- /feedback ---

- () The **Crab** sprite would need to be touching the colour blue

 --- feedback ---

 Not quite, look closely at the `operator`{:class="block3operators"} in the condition. 

 --- /feedback ---

- ( ) The **Crab** sprite will always `hide`{:class="block3looks"} `when the flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}

 --- feedback ---

 No, there is an `if`{:class="block3control"} block in the **Crab** sprite's code so it will only hide if the condition is met.

### Add more insects

Add more insects. You might need to make them move faster so they are harder for the Dragonfly to catch.

You can paint your own insects or trying adding an emoji mosquito!

--- task ---

Use the emoji keyboard to add a Mosquito emoji sprite. 

Duplicate an existing insect sprite then click on the **Costumes** tab. Paint a new costume and select the **Text** tool. Instead of typing text use the emoji keyboard shortcut for your Operating System:

Windows - Windows key + '.'
MacOS - ctrl + cmd + space
Linux - ctrl + '.'

Select the **Mosquito** emoji to insert it into the Paint editor. Use the **Select** (arrow) tool to centre, resize and rotate your Mosquito until you are happy with it.

**Tip:** Emojis can look different on different computers so they might not look the same on a tablet and a desktop computer. Some emojis aren't available on some computers, but most modern computers will support them.

**Tip:** Check that all your sprite and costumes have sensible names, it makes your project easier to understand if you come back to it later.

**Tip:** Make sure your code is laid out neatly in the Code area. Right-click on the Code area and choose 'Clean up Blocks' to get Scratch to tidy up your code.

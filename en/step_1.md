## Introduction

Make a nature simulation game with a dragonfly that grows bigger as it eats annoying mosquitos and other insects.

You will:
+ Use `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks make decisions based on **conditions** made with `operators`{:class="block3operators"} and `sensing`{:class="block3sensing"} blocks.
+ Use `random`{:class="block3operators"} numbers to control the movement of a sprite
+ Use the `Sounds`{:class="block3sound"}  editor to edit a sound

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
We use <span style="color: #0faeb0">**conditions**</span> all the time to make decisions. We could say “if it’s raining, then take an umbrella”. `If`{:class="block3control"} blocks and conditions let us write code that does something different depending on whether a condition is true or false.</p>

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Move the mouse (or your finger) around the Stage to eat insects. How do the insects move?

Which part of the dragonfly needs to touch the insects to eat them? What happens when the dragonfly reaches full size?

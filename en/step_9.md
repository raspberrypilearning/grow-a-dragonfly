### Add more insects

You can paint your own insects or trying adding an emoji mosquito!

--- task ---

Use the emoji keyboard to add a **Mosquito emoji** sprite.

Duplicate an existing **insect** sprite then click on the **Costumes** tab. **Paint** a new costume and select the **Text** tool. Instead of typing text, use the emoji keyboard shortcut for your Operating System:

- Windows - <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>
- MacOS - <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>
- Linux - <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>

Select the **Mosquito** emoji to insert it into the Paint editor. Use the **Select** (arrow) tool to centre, resize, and rotate your mosquito until you are happy with it.

**Tip:** Emojis can look different on different computers, so they might not look the same on a tablet and a desktop computer. Some emojis aren't available on some computers, but most modern computers will support them.

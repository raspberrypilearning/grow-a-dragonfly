### Add more insects

Use the emoji keyboard to add a Mosquito emoji sprite. 

Duplicate an existing insect sprite then click on the **Costumes** tab. Paint a new costume and select the **Text** tool. Instead of tying text use the emoji keyboard shortcut for your Operating System:

Windows - Windows key + '.'
MacOS - ctrl + cmd + space
Linux - ctrl + '.'

Select the **Mosquito** emoji to insert it into the Paint editor. Use the **Select** (arrow) tool to centre, resize and rotate your Mosquito until you are happy with it.

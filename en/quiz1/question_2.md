legend: Question 2 of 3
---

You wrote code to make the Dragonfly move only if it is `not`{:class="block3operators"} `touching`{:class="block3sensing"} the mouse pointer.

Where would you put a `start sound`{:class="block3sound"} to make the Dragonfly start a sound each time it moves?

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
+start sound [Wings v]
if <not <touching [mouse-pointer v] ?> > then
point towards (mouse-pointer v)
move [5] steps
end
end
```

No, with this code the `start sound`{:class="block3sound"} block is outside the `if`{:class="block3control"} block so it will run every time the `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop runs, even if the Dragonfly doesn't move.

Yes, that's correct. Placing the `start sound`{:class="block3sound"} block inside the `if`{:class="block3control"} block means it will play when the Dragonfly moves.
